# Discussions

The following is a collection of useful Slack discussions that have yet to
manifest into well curated doc content.

---

> Jon: Kyle and Tim, what do you think of this:

```
The nteract organization was started for the open
exploration of interactive computing application specs, tech, and designs.
The purpose is to encourage a collaborative environment.
```

> Kyle: Looking good. The main reason we put nteract together was to explore
> interactive computing experiences. To provide new platforms for others to
> build on, all while mentoring, teaching amongst ourselves, and welcoming in
> others to collaborate with us.

> Tim: Who you are you aiming it at Jon?

> Jon: Potential new contributors :)

> Tim: As a techie developer type, it doesn't excite me because it is "fluffy"

```
The nteract project/organisation explores what is possible (and impossible)
in interactive computing experiences. We investigate cutting edge technology
to build small components that others can combine to build the next big thing.
nteract is all about learning: together and from each other.
```

> Tim: not much better in terms of fluff :confused: . I read it and still don't
really know what `nteract` is about. "What the heck is an interactive computing
experience? Do you guys work on oculus rift?" So yeah, i think if we can find a
more concrete word for "interactive computing experience" that would be good

> Jon: What about "interactive software development and content authoring"?
> It's more specific

> Kyle: I guess I conflated nteract the org with nteract the notebook . I like
> interactive computing better than software development. The notebook is not
> where I go for software development itself, otherwise I would author the
> notebook in a notebook

> Tim: interactive
> interact interactively with interactions

_Tim has nothing :disappointed:_

> Kyle: A+ that's stellar Tim. At least it's entertaining

> Tim: Interaction as a service

> Kyle: gosh, no as a service jokes. I hear those 30x a day

> Tim: What ​*is*​ nteract about?
> running code
> seeing results before the whole code is done running
> running stuff somewhere else
> same frontend for many different languages
> different frontends for the same language

> Jon: quick iteration and closeness to data

> Kyle: very good, all of that @betatim and @jdfreder (edited)

> Carol:

```
As contributors, we value exploration, creativity, respectful collaboration,
and a welcoming work environment. We formed the nteract organization to further
these values. We, the nteract team, encourage you to contribute as we explore
interactive computing, application specs, tech, and designs.
```

> Jon: ooo I like that

> Carol: Thought you might. Really it's just what you had, flipped from passive
> voice to active. :simple_smile:
