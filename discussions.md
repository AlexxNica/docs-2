# Discussions

The following is a collection of useful Slack discussions that have yet to
manifest into well currated doc content.

jdfreder @rgbkrk: @betatim what do you think of this :
[2:44 PM]
```
*/begin{Elevator pitch}*  
The nteract organization was started as an organization for the open
exploration of interactive computing application specs, tech, and designs.
The purpose is to encourage a collaborative environment where not one tech,
spec, design, or notebook rules them all.  Instead, natural selection will
determine which will survive.
*/end{Elevator pitch}*
```

rgbkrk I'd probably remove the bits about natural selection and "rule them all", it sounds like a defensive position against another notebook
[5:04 PM]
This is for the notebook tutorial
[5:04 PM]
?
[5:30 PM]
jdfreder Yeah, it's down in the nteract section

[5:31 PM]
How's that?
[5:56 PM]
rgbkrk Looking good
[5:58 PM]
The main reason we put nteract together was to explore interactive computing experiences
[5:58 PM]
To provide new platforms for others to build on
[5:59 PM]
All while mentoring, teaching amongst ourselves, and welcoming in others to collaborate with us.

betatim who you are you aiming it at @jdfreder ?
[10:40 PM]
jdfreder @betatim: potential new contributors :)
[10:40 PM]
betatim also, with half my :coffee: consumed I realised that you posted an improved version already :simple_smile:
[10:41 PM]
as a techie developer type, it doesn't excite me because it is "fluffy"
[10:43 PM]
```
The nteract project/organisation explores what is possible (and impossible)
in interactive computing experiences. We investigate cutting edge technology
to build small components that others can combine to build the next big thing.
nteract is all about learning: together and from each other.

not much better in terms of fluff :confused:
[10:44 PM]
i read it an still don't really know what `nteract` is about
[10:45 PM]
"what the heck is an interactive computing experience? Do you guys work on oculus rift?"
[10:47 PM]
so yeah, i think if we can find a more concrete word for "interactive computing experience" that would be good
[10:52 PM]
github BOT
[nteract/nteract] New comment by betatim on issue #298: Error on starting nteract
Switched to `nvm` and still no luck. Had several problems while `npm install` was running when it printed `cb() not called` as well as a sha verification failing. Those I put down to shaky internet. Successfully installed everything again but get same error when starting `nteract`.

jdfreder What about "interactive software development and content authoring"?  It's more specific
[7:24 AM]
rgbkrk I guess I conflated nteract the org with nteract the notebook
[7:25 AM]
I like interactive computing better than software development
[7:25 AM]
The notebook is not where I go for software development itself, otherwise I would author the notebook in a notebook

[7:29 AM]
betatim what ​*is*​ nteract about?
[7:29 AM]
running code
[7:29 AM]
seeing results before the whole code is done running
[7:31 AM]
running stuff somewhere else
[7:31 AM]
same frontend for many different languages
[7:31 AM]
